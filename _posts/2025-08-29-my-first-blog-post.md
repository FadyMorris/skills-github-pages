### Publications
- M. Abadeer, F. Ebeid, and S. Gorlatch, **"Integration of Machine Learning Methods into Agent-based Simulations for Predicting Evacuation Time in Disaster Scenarios"**, Singapore,2022, 2022 3rd Asia Symposium on Signal Processing (ASSP), pp. 71-81, doi: 10.1109/ASSP57481.2022.00020

  **Abstract**:  
  The behavior of people during an evacuation may have a significant impact
  on evacuation time, so it has been extensively studied using agent-based
  simulations. This paper aims to use machine learning for predicting agent
  evacuation time faster in advance, rather than waiting the entire
  simulation time. We use the well-known machine-learning polynomial
  regression as our prediction model, and linear regression and decision tree
  regression as our benchmark models. In order to generate a suitable dataset
  for training and validating our models, we automate the scenario-creation
  process from a single template scenario and the simulation output
  extraction process in the Vadere simulation framework. Our simulation
  experiments are carried out using the structure plan of the University of
  Münster's administrative building, with up to 100 agents located in a
  source room as individuals and in groups, attempting to find the shortest
  path to an exit. We significantly improve evacuation prediction using
  machine learning regression models in agentbased simulation experiments.
  Our polynomial regression model can predict evacuation time before the
  simulation begins, and the prediction results are close to the simulation
  results, with an average R2 score of 84%
